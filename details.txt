In the Hotel services table 
I addded the following colums 
-closing time for services that have a closing time
-availability for services that are available or not 
-reasons to precise the reason in case it is not available 

And i created a table for different payment methods to use it as a foreign key in the billing table 
Because each payment is unique and thus must have it's own id
